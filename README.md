
## Personalyze -- (Customer Segmentation)

## Problem statement

The project is based on personality segmentation and  will be able predict the personality of the customer using machine learning algorithms. This project will be very usefull for malls, various stores and companies which are product based. Based on customer's personal details and purchase details, we can cluster them and we can predict the customer's cluster number using classification techniques.

## Tech Stack Used

1. Python
2. FastAPI
3. Machine learning algorithms
4. Mongo Db

## Infrastructure required
3. Github Actions

## Models Used

* [K-Means](https://www.javatpoint.com/k-means-clustering-algorithm-in-machine-learning)
* [LogisticRegression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html)

From these above models after hyperparameter optimization we selected these two models which were K-Means for clustering and Logistic Regression for classification and used the following in Pipeline.

* GridSearchCV is used for Hyperparameter Optimization in the pipeline.

## Conclusion

- This Project can be used in real-life by Users.
